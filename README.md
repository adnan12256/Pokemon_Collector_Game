#POKEMON COLLECTOR GAME
Welcom to my game! This is a simple game I'm making using inspiration from the games I played on the browser growing up.
I will try to add more functionalities to this game as I learn new things and make more time. Right now I am currently 
working, so I only code this when I'm really bored.

#Functionalities:
- Sign up page
- Login page
- Saving login data and pokemon picked to my storage data (users.txt) lol

##Important Commands:
pyuic5 -x SettingsGUI.ui -o SettingsGUI.py

## Coding Notes:
- If the users.txt file is empty when running the code, it will throw an error. There must be a dictionary {} already in
  the file.
- Need to change picture locations in SignupGUI for the labels with pictures in them (eg. "1.png" to "sugimori/1.png")
